# Contribution Guidelines for To-Do List App

Thank you for considering contributing to our To-Do List app! We appreciate your efforts to help make it even better. Please review the following guidelines before submitting your pull requests to ensure a smooth collaboration.

## 1. Add Only Relevant Code
- Avoid modifying existing code unless necessary for the change you are implementing.
- Refrain from using the "Format Document" option in your editor, as it makes it harder to review the actual changes.

## 2. Provide Visual Context
- Always include a screenshot or screen recording of your changes in action.
- Include a clear description of what changes were made, why they were made, and how they improve the app.

## 3. Follow Code Style Guidelines
- Stick to the current coding style and structure used in the app.
- Maintain consistent indentation, variable names, and function names to ensure readability and clarity.

## 4. Avoid Adding Unnecessary Dependencies
- Before adding a new library or dependency, explain its purpose in your pull request and confirm that it is essential for the feature or bug fix you're implementing.

## 5. Test Thoroughly
- Make sure your changes work as expected and do not introduce any bugs or performance issues.
- Test your code on different devices and screen sizes to ensure compatibility.

## 6. Test Across Browsers
- Test your changes in **Chrome** and **Firefox** to ensure that the app functions properly across both browsers.

## 7. Keep Pull Requests Focused
- Each pull request should focus on a single feature or bug fix. Please avoid bundling multiple, unrelated changes in one pull request.

## 8. Document Changes
- If your changes introduce new functionality or modify existing features, update the documentation accordingly.
- If necessary, include any relevant notes or instructions for other developers.

By following these guidelines, we can maintain a clean, efficient codebase and make the review process faster and smoother. Thank you for your contributions to improving the To-Do List app!
